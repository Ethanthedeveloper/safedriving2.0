# ■ MY MISSION ■
Safe Driving 2.0 is made with the goal of taking advantage of Forza Horizon 5's amazing graphical capabilities and its Xbox compatibility to bring people an experience like educational driving games such as City Car Driving *(Made by Forward Development ❤️)*, featuring a full city, main highway, county highways, and interstates.

# ● HOW DO I INSTALL IT ●
There is no need to install this as it is an event found in the EventLab on Forza Horizon 5. (*Instructions in releases found in the release section of this GitHub*)

# What happened to 1.0?
Well, I was in the middle of working on 1.0 and my Xbox overheated and restarted; therefore, my work was corrupted.
